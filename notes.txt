Run as a web app

When the user asks for a random function then pull a random one
Otherwise just pick from all modules randomly
 - Ignore deprecated ones
They can also ask for a specific module name and it will pull a random one from it
Specify python version


Eventually go to read the docs or sphynx

Cache locally? Store in JSON files?

Some modules only have methods to a class. Should I parse these as well?
